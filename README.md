# StyleganSetup_anaconda
Saw that there wasnt really a guide for setting up the environemnt so made a jupyter notebook with instructions to get the environemnt set up in anaconda 




### Instructions

Instructions are provided in the Stygan+Setup+.ipynb

I used a GTX 1060 for the setup and ubuntu 18.04
